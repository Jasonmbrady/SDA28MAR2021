// - PriorityQueue (create enqueue and dequeue methods)
//   - Design a new PriorityQueue class where the queue maintains an ascending order when items are added based on a queue item's provided priority integer value. A priority value of 1 is most important which means it should be at the front of the queue, the first to be dequeued.

class QElement {
    constructor(element, priority) {
      // element is the given item to be added to the queue.
      this.element = element
      this.priority = priority
    }
  }

   * Class to represent a PriorityQueue with methods that enforce the correct
   * order of queue items.
